Okay, let's see. The problem is to take an input integer a between 1 and 30 and output another integer. The example given is when the input is 3, the output is 27. Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. So maybe the task is to compute a cubed? That seems straightforward. Wait, but let me think again. Are there other possibilities?

Let me check if there's another pattern. Suppose for a=1, the output would be 1, which is 1^3. For a=2, 8 (2^3). The example fits. So it's likely that the problem is to output a^3. So t
