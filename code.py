Okay, let's see. The problem is to take an integer a between 1 and 30 and output a single integer. The example given is input 3 outputs 27. Hmm, 3 cubed is 27. Oh right, maybe the task is just to compute a cubed? So the output is a multiplied by itself three times. That seems straightforward. Wait, but maybe there's a trick? Let me think again. Let's see another example. If a is 2, then output would be 8, which is 2^3, and for 1 it's 1. So yeah, probably just the cube of a.

So the solution woul
