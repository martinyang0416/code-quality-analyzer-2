In Omkar's last class of math, he learned about the least common multiple, or LCM. LCM(a, b) is the smallest positive integer x which is divisible by both a and b.

Omkar, having a laudably curious mind, immediately thought of a problem involving the LCM operation: given an integer n, find positive integers a and b such that a + b = n and LCM(a, b) is the minimum value possible.

Can you help Omkar solve his ludicrously challenging math problem?
