Okay, I need to solve this programming problem. Let's see what the question is. The input is an integer a between 0 and 35, and I have to output another integer. The examples show that when the input is 3, the output is 8, and for 10 it's 1024. Hmm, let's think about what's going on here.

Wait, 3 gives 8. 8 is 2^3. Oh right, but then 10 gives 1024 which is 2^10. Oh! So maybe the problem is to compute 2 raised to the power of a? Because 2^3 is 8, and 2^10 is 1024. That fits the examples.
