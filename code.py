Okay, I need to solve this programming problem where the input is an integer a between 0 and 35, and I have to output another integer. Let's see the examples they gave. When the input was 3, the output was 8. Hmm, 2^3 is 8. Oh right, maybe it's 2 raised to the power of a? But wait, let's check the second example. Input 10 gives 1024. Oh yeah, 2^10 is 1024. So that makes sense. So the problem is probably to compute 2^a. 

Wait, but why would the input be up to 35? Because 2^35 is a pretty big num
