Okay, so I have this programming problem to solve. Let's see what it's about. The input is a single integer a between 1 and 30, and I need to output another integer. The example given is when the input is 3, the output is 27. Hmm, wait, 3 cubed is 27. Oh right, maybe the problem is just to compute a cubed? But let me think again. Because maybe there's a trick here. Let me check. If a is 3, then 3*3*3 is 27, which matches the example. So perhaps the problem is indeed to output the cube of the inp
